# NOTES

- In python, **import** statement can be used to import functions from another file.
- **from... import** can be used to import specific functions avoiding potential naming conflicts.
- A module is a file containing Python definitions and declarations.
- You can create a module by creating a '.py' file containing functions, varibles, 
  and classes you want to use in other files.
- dir() is used to find out which names a module defines.
- dir() does not list the names of built-in functions and variables.
- argparse provide more complex mechanism to process command line arguments.
- A special variable *__name__* prevents a code in script from being executed when imported.
