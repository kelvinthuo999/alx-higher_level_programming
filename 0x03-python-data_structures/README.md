# NOTES

- A list is data structure that holds an ordered collection of items.
- Index numbers represent the position of each element in a list.
- Strings are a sequence of characters and are used to represent text.
- Some of the common methods of lists inlcude:
	* append()
	* extend()
	* insert()
	* remove()
	* pop()
	* index()
	* cound()

- A stack is a data structure where elements are added and removed from the top(LIFO).
- A queue is a data structure where elements are added from the back and removed
  from the front(FIFO).
- List comprehensions are a concise and expressive way to create lists in python.
- Basic syntax of list comprehensions:
	new_list = [expression for item in iterable if condition]
- Lists are created using square brackets.
- A tuple is a data structure that holds an ordered collection of items.
- The main difference between a tuple and  list is that a tuple is immutable.
- Tuples are created using round brackets.
- Tuples are commmonly used to return multiple values from a function.
- Tuples are more memory efficient and slightly faster to access compared to lists.
- Mutability and data integrity are guiding factors when deciding wchich to use bw
