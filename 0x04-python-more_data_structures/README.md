# NOTES

- A set is an unordered collection of unique elements, used to store and manage a group of values
  which are unique.
- Sets are created using {} braces or the set() constructor.
- Some of the most common methods used with sets include:
	* add() : adds an element to the set.
	* remove(element) : removes an element.
	* discard(element) : removes an element from the set if it exists.
	* pop() : removes and returns an arbitrary element from the set.
	* clear() : removes all the elements from the set.
	* union(another_set) : returns a new set containing all elements from both sets.
	* intersection(other_set) : returns a new set containing common elements from both sets.
	* difference(other_set) : Returns a new set with elements from the first set that are not in the second set.
	* symmetric_difference: Returns a new set with elements that are in either set, but not both. 
- Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value pairs that allow efficient storage, retrival, 
  and manipulation of data using unique keys as identifiers.
- A key in dictionary is a unique identifier used to access associated values.
- A lambda function is a compact and anonymous function used for simple, one-line operations without the need 
  for formal function definition.
